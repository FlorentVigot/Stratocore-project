# PPMS
![alt text](https://ppms.us/stratocore.png)
Platform for research institutes. I developed this platform which includes 2 functions: dark mode and adding sections.

## How to use ?
To launch the project, open a terminal and type the command `php -S localhost:8000`
To use the platform, you can choose your mode (light or dark). Then, you can add sections by pressing the button. You choose the sections you want. You can add or cancel. When you have finished, you can close the pop-up window.

## Technologies

I used Vue 3 and modern CSS. The WCAG is good.

## Graphic Chart

### Color

I have chosen the following colours:
<br>
`Light mode:`

- `White` is used as the main background for a bright, clear interface. This creates a strong contrast with the textual and interactive elements.
- `#EDF2F7` Light grey to structure the interface for header and footer
- `#2D3748` Charcoal black to highlight text
- `#BF215B` & `#BF215B` blue and pink color for buttons and interactive elements.
<br>
`Dark mode:`

- `#1A202C` Main color. Navy blue is a colour associated with reliability, stability and confidence. In the scientific field, it also represents rigour and technical expertise.
- `#F7FAFC` Main text.
- `#68D391` Green for growth and efficiency.
- `#2D3748` Background for header and footer

### Font

- `Inter` is usued for main text
- `Roboto` is usued for secondary text such as buttons, lists,
